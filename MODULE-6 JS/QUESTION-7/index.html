  <h2>QUESTION-7<br> <span>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</span> </h2>  <br>

  <h1>View State :</h1>
  <p>ViewState: It is maintained at only one level that is page-level. Changes made on a single page is not visible on other pages. Information that is gathered in view state is stored for the clients only and cannot be transferred to any other place. View state is synonymous with serializable data only.</p> <br>


  <h1>Session State :</h1>
  <p>SessionState: It is maintained at session-level and data can be accessed across all pages in the web application. The information is stored within the server and can be accessed by any person that has access to the server where the information is stored.</p>
